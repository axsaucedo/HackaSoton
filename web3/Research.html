						  </p>
							<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.">The web has gone through several major transitions, which have been generalised as “Web 1.0” and “Web 2.0”. The transition to Web 2.0 has involved the move towards technologies such as AJAX and XML, and user generated content such as blogs (Wang, Zahadat, 2009). Unlike Web 1.0, interactive pages containing dynamically generated content became easy to build.</span><br>
                              <br>
                             Web 3.0 is a transition towards a new generation of the web. Although it’s meaning is not that well defined, it can be used to mean the semantic web; a structured and universal way of defining and linking data (Bernes-Lee, 2001). Many also believe it to mean the evolution of social media such as Facebook and Twitter (Silva, Rahman, Saddick, 2008), or a shift towards web-based apps and cloud storage.<br>
                              <br>
                             For example, the semantic web is a concept where, rather than just being laid out on a HTML page, data on the web is represented in a computer-readable form, such as RDF (resource description format). This is a similar idea to RSS, which is used to represent blog posts in XML format - the only difference is that is applies to any kind of information, and exists across the whole internet. This idea has been pioneered by Tim Bernes-Lee (2001), and is already being implemented by the W3C and used (W3C, 2011)<br>
                              <br>
                            <strong>&quot;Bridging the gap between real and virtual...&quot;</strong><br>
                            <br>
                              The next generation of the web is also seen by some as a way of bridging the gap between the “real” and the “virtual” worlds (Silva, Rahman, Saddick, 2008). In the age where all kinds of information can be accessed directly from the web, as well as the increased connectivity of objects, the web can become much more integrated into our lives. For example, home automation systems, which have already been developed, can connect to the web and interact with our lives more intelligently. A fridge might tell us when food goes out of date, and our phone could text us when a bus is about to arrive at the bus stop you are waiting at.<br>

                                </strong>
						  </p>
							<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.">Perhaps one of the most important ways in which the web is influenced is the development of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. PCs and laptops were developed before the web was a big thing - or even around at all; mobile devices, however, have been developed in an age where the web has become an important part of most people’s lives.</span><br>
                              <br>
                             As as result we are seeing devices which have two critical features: portability and connectivity. There is plenty of evidence to show that the use of mobile devices is increasing rapidly - over a triple increase in tablet sales in 2012 than 2011 (IDC, 2012), and we are using these devices more and more for our day-to-day activities.  We are also getting an upgrade to 4G mobile internet (BBC, 2012), which means that we are all connected, all of the time, wherever we are.<br>
                              <br>
                            Information can now be delivered to us as and when it becomes available. Our location, acquired using GPS, can be used to tailor this information to make it specific and relevant. Not only is the semantic web available instantly through these devices, they connect us to every other object which is connected. In the vision of bridging the gap between real and virtual, we can be constantly connected to things we interact with.<br>

							<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.">It is important for businesses to keep up to date with the trends in technology; not least companies that provide services on the web.</span><br>
                              <br>
                           Businesses are focused around the customer, and as such information on the type of customers is valuable. Companies like Amazon track the buying habits of customers to build up an idea of their interests, and suggests products they might like to buy. With many other online retailers doing similar things (Tasner, 2010), this demonstrates that harvesting and processing data is an important tool of the modern web, and a large part of Web 3.0 lies in computer-generated data such as this.<br>
                              <br>
                            Some people believe that computer-generated information is a part of Web 3.0: Conrad Wolfram has said “that’s Web 3.0 … the computer is generating new information” (2010). Some people believe that computer-generated information is a part of Web 3.0: Conrad Wolfram has said “that’s Web 3.0 … the computer is generating new information” (2010). Cloud hosting is an upcoming trend, and will be a key part of the infrastructure for Web 3.0 services. Businesses willing to keep up with the development of the web fill find the flexibility of cloud hosting important.

						  </p>
							<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.">With the increase in mobile devices (IDC, 2012), the cheap price of small embedded computers allows many more real-world objects to be attached to a computer, such as sensors in your home, health care systems and food packaging. The idea of connecting all these computers together is known as the hyperconnected web (Verizon, 2010) and allows us to collect and use information from objects in the real world - the internet of things, so called because the number of devices connected to the internet has exceeded the population (Frey, 2012).</span><br>
                              <br>
                           To make the hyperconnected web effective, a number of sensors are needed. We are already seeing smartphones and tablets fitted with GPS, but we can expect the devices fitted to other objects to contain sensors for pressure, chemical, moisture, vibration speed, for example (Frey 2012).<br>
                              <br>
                            An important development which allows the internet of things to grow is IPv6 (Verizon, 2010). Until the roll out of the new internet protocol, which is still ongoing, the number of addresses was (and still is) limiting the number of devices that can connect to the internet. With the new addressing scheme, there is such as large supply of addresses that it is inconceivable that it will run out.

						  </p>
							<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.">The development of Web 3.0 technologies means that we have to consider the security implications. The development of Web 2.0 technologies had many security issues, mainly due to the speed at which it was being developed. These security issues include law enforcement and privacy, as well as hacking and phishing (IBM, 2012).</span><br>
                              <br>
                           It is therefore important that developers and businesses think about the potential security issues of these technologies, and learn from the mistakes of Web 2.0.<br>
